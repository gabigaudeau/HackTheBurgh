First off, take that stupid fucking hat off and throw it in the trash.  You have no girlfriend because you dress like a goon, you\u2019re fat as fuck, and you play games all day.  You have depression because you have no girlfriend and you find comfort in food, which makes you fatter, which makes you less desirable, which makes you feel worse about yourself.  It\u2019s a cycle.  I used to be like you...never had a  girlfriend while I was a fat fuck, so I ate and I played games.  \n\nHere is how you break the cycle.  Make a decision to make small changes.  Play video games for 7 hours a day, and go outside and walk for one.  Try to walk 3 miles in that hour.  After you can walk three miles in an hour, work in jogging, even if it\u2019s in two minute periods with 8 minutes of recovery walking.  Repeat that until you can jog a whole mile, then add in some running till you\u2019re tired, then walk, then jog.  Do some pushups, and when you get tired, go to your knees and keep pushing.  Try doing some sit-ups.  Do 10 push-ups and 10 sit-ups an hour while gaming, waiting in a game lobby for the next round to begin is the perfect time for this.  Work that number up by 1 or 2 per hour every week.\n\nEat less, and make better choices.  Put your hands together, laid out flat.  If your meal won\u2019t fit on top of your two hands together, it\u2019s too much food.  Don\u2019t eat after 8 pm, give up dessert, and only drink 0 calorie beverages.\n\nIf you are in high school and there is a wrestling team, join it.  In high school I dropped from 230 to 187 in a three month wrestling season.  Practice hard every day, and don\u2019t quit even when you want to.  You will probably lose every match, but that\u2019s okay...it\u2019s not about winning, it\u2019s about self improvement.\n\nFix your shit, my friend, because a fat, lazy, depressed teen can either fix their shit, or they will be a fat, lazy, lonely, depressed adult, and regardless of what you may tell yourself, that\u2019s not what you want for yourself.", "You look like a personification of an old Big Mac", "You didn't need to put that you don't have a girlfriend in the caption.
